Exploring the a use case of machine learning on UK Traffic Accident data set to classify accident severity

## Introduction
Historically, accidents insurance plans and payments are calculated using actuarial models. Now
with the boom of data collection in insurance industry, we should be able to leverage machine
learning to assist with the insurance industry.
The following project explores a potential usage of machine learning in the insurance industry - to predict the accident severity of a car accident

The target variable is thus accident severity which comes in 3 level:
1. Slight
2. Serious
3. Fatal

Thus we are dealing with a multi-class classification problem/analysis.

Using this prediction results, we can help insurance companies to:
1. Evaluate insurance claims payment
2. Evaluate the underwriting of insurance plan
3. Insurance claim fraud prediction/investigation
